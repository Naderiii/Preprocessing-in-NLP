# Data cleaning Project in NLP

In this project, we answer the following questions related to data cleaning by considering the attached dataset using Python programming language.

The dataset we have provided is for social media and is raw data. That means that data is not cleaned. We first should clean it. As you know there are many techniques for data cleaning some of which have been done in this project.

Some necessary cleaning techniques for dataset applied:
* Remove newlines and Tabs

* Hashtag removes
* Tokenization

* Remove HTML tags
* Repeated characters reduction, for example: Hellllo → Hello
* Remove capitalization/ Case normalization
* Remove Whitespaces, for instance, He llo → Hello
* Typo Correction/ Misspelled words: big “dada” → big “data”
* Stemming or lemmatization
